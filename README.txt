Requirements
1. Save the e-mail, first name, last name and phone number of the user into a mySQL db.
2. Load the info using a list


***********************
Added jQuery sort functionality (has it's downsides but with small tables works ok)
Added validations to form
I used a table instead of a list because it I tought it would be more readable
